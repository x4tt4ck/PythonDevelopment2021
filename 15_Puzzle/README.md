# Development roadmap
- [x] Create skel
- [x] Create 17 buttons and grid them
- [ ] Buttons are placed randomly during game startup
- [ ] Window resize must change buttons size
- [ ] New button refreshes the button layout
- [ ] If freespace's neighbor button is pushed, it moves the freespace
- [ ] When buttons are allocated in proper order, you win and the layout is refreshed
